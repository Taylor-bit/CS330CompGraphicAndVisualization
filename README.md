I addressed software design with an emphasis on modularity, clarity, and iteration while creating my 3D scene. I went over every learning module early in the course and applied what I learned to create a well-organized project plan. I developed unique functions like RenderTree() and RenderTableAndCup() as the scene changed in order to maintain the organization and reusability of my code. I learned how to handle complexity, organize logic, and refine shapes thanks to this design process, which was fueled by feedback and milestone progression. Learning how to create and reuse transformation pipelines for various objects was one of the more useful design skills I acquired. This made it much simpler to add and modify components of the scene. I now have a greater understanding of how design and coding interact in computational graphics as applying materials, textures, and lighting effects needed attention to both technical precision and visual detail.

I learned how to work iteratively and adaptably on the development side of things from this project. Every milestone improved my knowledge of OpenGL and scene composition, from managing orthographic projection and camera movement to applying lighting effects and alpha blending into practice. In order to create a genuine sunset ambiance, I experimented with material qualities like shininess and ambient strength. I also utilized alpha blending to approximate transparency, example in the glass that surrounds the orange juice. It was crucial to iterate; I kept going back to adjust previous objects' size, positioning, or lighting effects. My approach to coding has thus grown more methodical and meticulous. I've learned from this experience how important computational graphics may be to achieving my academic and career objectives. The abilities I've acquired, such as modular thinking, 3D reasoning, and shader-based rendering, will be a solid basis for producing immersive, captivating digital realities, whether I choose to pursue more studies in interactive media or work on real-time visualization projects.
